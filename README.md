# Colab AI Notebooks

This repository contains some AI Colab jupyter notebooks I use every now and then.

## Notebooks
- **Media subtitle generator**: What it says on the tin. Generates subtitles
  for media files using [OpenAI Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper)
- **Waifu2x/Real-ESRGAN upscalers**: Two image upscaler scripts using
  [Waifu2x](github.com/nagadomi/nunif) and
[Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN), respectively. Use
Waifu2x if you want to retain some image noise, and Real-ESRGAN for arbitrary
image scaling/relatively better quality
